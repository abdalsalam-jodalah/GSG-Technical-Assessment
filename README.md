# GSG-Technical-Assessment
GSG-Technical Assessment for React and Next js bootcamp

I have 2 branches:
- main branch: the required submissions
- React branch: the react project contains the tasks

I misunderstood the requirements initially. 
I implemented the tasks in a React project since you attached a React tutorial and gave an introduction about it. 
After understanding the correct submission format,
I pushed each task to its branches.
